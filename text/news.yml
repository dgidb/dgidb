    - headline: DGIdb beta is launched at AGBT 2013
      article: >
        The 14th annual Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) meeting was held in Marco Island, Florida, on February 20-23, 2013. 
        A poster describing DGIdb was presented by Obi Griffith and results from DGIdb were described during a talk delivered by Malachi Griffith 
        in the Genomic Medicine session. The first publicly available release of DGIdb includes 2 sources of canonical gene information, 
        1 source of drug information, 5 sources of drug-gene interactions and 4 sources of potentially druggable gene categories.

    - headline: MyCancerGenome is added as a source for DGIdb
      article: > 
        Highly curated drug-gene interactions have been mined from <a href="http://www.mycancergenome.org/">My Cancer Genome</a> and incorporated 
        into DGIdb. My Cancer Genome is a freely available online personalized cancer medicine resource and decision-making tool for physicians, 
        patients, caregivers and researchers.  From this resource we obtained 835 drug-gene interactions involving 169 genes and 226 drugs.

    - headline: Clearity Clinical Trials added as a new source of drug-gene interactions
      article : >
        The previous ClearityFoundation source of interactions has been renamed to ClearityFoundationBiomarkers and a new source ClearityFoundationClinicalTrial has been added. The former are biomarkers determined by the Clearity Foundation to be relevant for (typically) sensitivity or resistance to a specific therapeutic agent in Ovarian Cancer. The latter are interactions that were manually curated from the list of relevant clinical trials (themselves manually curated) by the Clearity Foundation as of potential relevance to Ovarian Cancer patients.
